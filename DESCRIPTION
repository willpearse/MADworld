Description: Provides a series of wrapper functions that integrate all
    the official packages within the MADworld. This includes stable
    packages (e.g., MADtraits and MADcomm), as well as prototype
    packages (e.g., MADpandemic and MADneon). Contains synthetic
    functions for joining data distributed among MAD packages (e.g.,
    MADecology), as well as wrapper functions to generate useful
    auxilliary data (e.g., phylogenies and geographic data).
